Have you ever played "Sonar"? <br>
"Sonar" is a strategic board game that can play up to 8-player (each side 4-player), the more player you have the more likely your going to win. Bcause there are many task to do like calculate opponent possible location, planning maneuver, manage resource. But with this solver you could easily won a 1v4. Because human can't calculate all opponent possible move like a machine. You just worried about maneuvering and managing resource, let the solver figuring out where you opponent submarine is. <br><br>
